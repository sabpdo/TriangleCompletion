# TriangleCompletion

This is a project/experiment coded in Unity in the language C#. I built the environment and the experiment, created the trial structure, and implemented code to export the trial data. 

The experiment itself is called Triangle Completion, and it is a common homing task to test path integration in spatial neuroscience research. To describe the specifics of the trial structure, triangle completion consists of walking one outbound leg, turning, and then walking along a second outbound leg. At the end of the outbound path, participants are instructed to turn to face their starting location and click the mouse once they were facing the start location. They are then instructed to walk forward toward the starting location and to stop and click the space bar again when they reached that location.

There is both a open field and hallway condition which I created, and there are six different triangle types. For more information on the task, please refer to pages 17-18 on this paper entitled "Executing the Homebound Path Is a Major Source of Error" by Dr. Chrastil and Dr. Warren linked here: https://cpb-us-e2.wpmucdn.com/faculty.sites.uci.edu/dist/2/859/files/2021/03/Chrastil_Warren_ExecutionErrorPathIntegration-3.pdf.
